-- The H re-model (ETHOS-InformationHealth.md § Decision fork / § Re-model; polaris#383,
-- git tag ethos-h-flat-baseline). Truthfulness assurance T is a PARALLEL system of
-- independent checks V_j, not the flat scalar t of Branch F:
--     T = 1 - Π_j (1 - c_j)      [an error is caught if ANY independent check catches it]
-- This Lean carries the numeric structure function DL cannot express; the OWL
-- (ethos:VerificationLayer, ethos:RedundantVerificationLayer ⊑ assuredBy min 2
-- IndependentVerificationMechanism) carries the qualitative redundancy structure.
-- The theorem below mechanizes "capture = de-redundancy": capture collapses the
-- independent V_j into one effective check, dropping T from 1-Π(1-c_j) down toward a
-- single c_i — and the redundant layer always dominates that single check.

    collapses the layer toward a single surviving check `c i`; this theorem is the exact

## Dual-stratum framing --- documented, enforced by construction

ETHOS's distinctive framing (Orphan 7 of the ETHOS audit) is that community
and institution co-exist without reduction. That claim is enforced at the
type layer by construction: `EthosEpistemicCommunity r` is a subtype of
`HOAState r` (a structure with agents / substrate / loopEndowment / etc.
fields), while `EthosEpistemicInstitution` is a typedef over `SigmaActor`
(an opaque Core carrier type). There is no cast between them --- ETHOS's
dual-stratum claim holds at the Lean type layer with no additional
theorems required.

Peer-side operations that relate the two --- e.g., "which community
sustains this institution?" --- would be modeled as separate axiom
relations (`sustains : EthosEpistemicInstitution → (r : Region) →
EthosEpistemicCommunity r → Prop`), reserved for future peer-specialization
work that goes beyond U2's HOA-typing scope.
