-- ETHOS is the first peer to instantiate the §14 region machinery (first-binding
-- decision 2026-06-21; obsidian/SCORE/domains/B3RegionGeometry.md § "First binding"):
-- an epistemic community's corpus R(C) is a graded down-set of the citation /
-- derivation DAG ETHOS already builds for its quality measure Q
-- (obsidian/SCORE/emergence/applications/ETHOS-InformationHealth.md). This is a
-- *toy witness* — a 4-claim DAG across strata — proving the structure is inhabited
-- and the §14 theorems fire on a concrete ETHOS instance. Together with NEXUS (§16)
-- this is the ETHOS ∩ NEXUS overlap that promoted §14 to core. Real citation/
-- retraction networks are Q4 BIND (data, Phase F), not Lean.

-- §RV. ETHOS BRANCH R — OR-REDUNDANT VERIFICATION LAYER (2026-07-07)
-- The H re-model (ETHOS-InformationHealth.md § Decision fork / § Re-model; polaris#383,
-- git tag ethos-h-flat-baseline). Truthfulness assurance T is a PARALLEL system of
-- independent checks V_j, not the flat scalar t of Branch F:
--     T = 1 - Π_j (1 - c_j)      [an error is caught if ANY independent check catches it]
-- This Lean carries the numeric structure function DL cannot express; the OWL
-- (ethos:VerificationLayer, ethos:RedundantVerificationLayer ⊑ assuredBy min 2
-- IndependentVerificationMechanism) carries the qualitative redundancy structure.
-- The theorem below mechanizes "capture = de-redundancy": capture collapses the
-- independent V_j into one effective check, dropping T from 1-Π(1-c_j) down toward a
-- single c_i — and the redundant layer always dominates that single check.

/-- Redundant verification assurance: the probability at least one of `k` independent

/-- **Redundancy dominates any single check (capture = de-redundancy, mechanized).**
    For catch-probabilities in [0,1], the parallel verification layer is at least as strong
    as any one of its mechanisms. Capture correlates the ostensibly-independent checks and
    collapses the layer toward a single surviving check `c i`; this theorem is the exact
    cost of that collapse — the redundant layer sits `≥ c i`, so driving `κ → 1`
    (`T → c i`) can only lose the redundancy premium, never gain. -/

-- The HM Specialization Audit (`core/ethos/ETHOS_HM_Specialization_Audit.md`

-- (`ethos:EpistemicCommunity` refining SC-G-25 HOA / SC-G-26 HumanCommunity)
-- named the HOA analog at the glossary + OWL layer but no Lean
-- specialization instantiated §HM's `HOAState` machinery. This section is
-- that specialization plus a companion Σ-actor typedef for the co-existing
-- `EpistemicInstitution` (ET-G-02) that jointly encode the dual-stratum
-- framing (Orphan 7 of the ETHOS audit: "EpistemicCommunity + Epistemic-
-- Institution both first-class in E1; neither reduces to the other").
--
-- Third and final polar case of Design B's `Constituent` sum type after
-- AGORA (A-actor only, §PS-U2) and ATLAS (Σ-actor only, §PS-U2). ETHOS's
-- distinctive contribution: BOTH types co-exist as first-class objects
-- at the Lean layer, not just at the glossary layer --- the maintaining

    B₃-producing actor in the ETHOS domain. Encoded as a typedef over

    Σ-actor role Core already provides; no additional Lean structure
    needed for this tier. Capture-at-Σ (ownership concentration, funding

## Dual-stratum framing --- documented, enforced by construction

ETHOS's distinctive framing (Orphan 7 of the ETHOS audit) is that community
and institution co-exist without reduction. That claim is enforced at the
type layer by construction: `EthosEpistemicCommunity r` is a subtype of
`HOAState r` (a structure with agents / substrate / loopEndowment / etc.
fields), while `EthosEpistemicInstitution` is a typedef over `SigmaActor`
(an opaque Core carrier type). There is no cast between them --- ETHOS's
dual-stratum claim holds at the Lean type layer with no additional
theorems required.

Peer-side operations that relate the two --- e.g., "which community
sustains this institution?" --- would be modeled as separate axiom
relations (`sustains : EthosEpistemicInstitution → (r : Region) →
EthosEpistemicCommunity r → Prop`), reserved for future peer-specialization
work that goes beyond U2's HOA-typing scope.
