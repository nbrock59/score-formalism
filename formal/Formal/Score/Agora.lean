AGORA peer: the captured-correction impossibility lemma (SS13), the
legal-precedent network binding (SS17), and the maintenance-bridge
(§HM-Bridge) restating SS13 in the population/predicate vocabulary of
`HOAMaintenance` (Hook 3, §HM22) with an honest delta comment on why
the two are analogous but not formally reducible at this tier.

-- §HM-Bridge. AGORA MAINTENANCE-BRIDGE — restating SS13 in the
-- population/predicate vocabulary of Hook 3 (`HOAMaintenance` §HM22).
--
-- Purpose: make visible in Lean the correspondence between AGORA's SS13
-- `captured_correction_needs_independent_node` impossibility lemma and
-- the abstract `hoaFragilityHomogeneous` fragility theorem, WITHOUT
-- overclaiming a formal reduction that does not hold at this tier.
--
-- What lands here:
--   1. `AgoraCorrectingNode` opaque type + `nodeFloorOf` association
--      axiom — the AGORA-side analog of §HM22's `Agent` +
--      `agentCouplingWeightVector`.
--   2. `PopulationCorrectingNodeCaptured` predicate — the AGORA-side
--      sibling of §HM22's `PopulationCouplingHomogeneous`, structurally
--      parallel but scoped to a functional role (correcting nodes)
--      rather than the whole agent population.
--   3. `populationCaptured_reachableMismatch_nonzero` — a trivial
--      reformulation of SS13 in the new vocabulary, giving Hook-3-shaped
--      access to the AGORA impossibility.
--
-- What does NOT land here (deliberately):
--
-- A formal derivation of SS13 from `hoaFragilityHomogeneous`. Both
-- capture the intuition "uniformity along a specific axis prevents the
-- maintenance mechanism from operating", but at different formal levels:
--
--   * `captured_correction_needs_independent_node` is a POINT-LEVEL
--     ARITHMETIC BOUND: `nodeFloor > 0 → reachableMismatch ≠ 0`. A
--     single-state claim about what a given node configuration can
--     achieve.
--
--   * `hoaFragilityHomogeneous` is a TRACE-LEVEL DYNAMICS CLAIM:
--     `PopulationCouplingHomogeneous s → ∀ trace ∀ i, ¬ feedbackEngaged`.
--     A statement about how a homogeneous population's history must
--     evolve.
--
-- A reduction would require either
--   (a) a *partial-homogeneity* variant of Hook 3 predicating over a
--       functional role (correcting nodes) rather than all agents, or
--   (b) an abstract *structural-fragility* theorem that both impossi-
--       bility claims are instances of.
-- Neither exists at this tier; both are candidate future formalizations.
-- Until then, the correspondence is REAL but DOCUMENTED, not DERIVED.

--
-- Attempt to derive SS13 (`captured_correction_needs_independent_node`)
-- from Hook 3 (`hoaFragilityHomogeneous`) via specialization of
-- `AgoraCorrectingNode` over the abstract `Agent` type.
--
-- Purpose: run the actual generalization test — "either the reduction
-- goes through, or it fails at a specific place that names the missing
-- structure." This is the machine-checkable answer to the question
-- "does the abstract HOA-maintenance machinery correctly generalize
-- AGORA's existing formalization?"
--
-- Result: the specialization goes through cleanly at the TYPE level,
-- but the reduction attempt is *vacuous* at the PROOF level — SS13's
-- proof does not invoke Hook 3 at any point because SS13 is a
-- point-level ARITHMETIC bound while Hook 3 is a trace-level DYNAMICS
-- claim. The correspondence at the intuitive level ("role uniformity
-- → impossibility") does NOT lift to formal reduction.
--
-- Informative outcome: the mapping-table row §6.1 for `SS13 ↔ Hook 3`
-- in `AGORA_Interface_Contracts.md` is downgraded from "sibling" to
-- "same intuitive family, different formal shape; reduction attempted
-- and shown INAPPLICABLE." A candidate future theorem — SS13-dyn, a

### Experimental conclusion

The proof of `specialization_captured_reachable_nonzero` above:

  * uses no lemma from `HOAMaintenance.lean`;
  * uses no state, region, trace, or move-sequence structure;
  * uses no `PopulationCouplingHomogeneous` hypothesis;
  * uses no `hoaFragilityHomogeneous` invocation;
  * is closed by the same one-line arithmetic that proves the
    non-specialized SS13.

The Path (1) experiment therefore *falsifies* the claim that Hook 3
generalizes SS13 as currently formalized. The two theorems capture
different notions of "role-uniformity → impossibility":

  * SS13: **static arithmetic** — captured nodes have positive floors,
    and a positive floor is arithmetically nonzero.
  * Hook 3: **dynamic feedback disengagement** — homogeneous
    populations cannot fire the maintenance mechanism across a trace
    of moves.

A future theorem SS13-dyn (trace-level, about `CapturedCorrectionUpdate`
sequences failing to reach zero under a role-scoped restoration
intervention) would be a genuine Hook 3 generalization candidate,
requiring the partial-homogeneity Hook 3 variant flagged in
§HM-Bridge (candidate (a)). SS13-dyn does not currently exist in
AGORA's formalization; introducing it is future work.

Path (1) verdict on the abstract machinery: it does not generalize
SS13, and the reason is not "an axiom is missing" but "the theorems
operate at different semantic levels." Fixing this requires either
adjustment on the AGORA side (formulate SS13-dyn) or on the abstract
side (formulate a POINT-level static-fragility theorem that Hook 3
would specialize to). The one-directional intuition that Hook 3 is
"the more general form" was wrong.

-- This section makes explicit that AGORA's SS13 is an instance of
-- `point_fragility_positive_floor`. The witness upgrades AGORA U3 AND
-- U6 from Awkward (SS13 does not specialize §HM's trace-level machinery)
-- to Present-Formal (SS13 specializes §HM30's point-level
-- point_fragility_positive_floor). Both U3 and U6 resolve via the same
-- witness because they shared the same root cause; adding point-level
-- machinery to §HM addresses both simultaneously.
--
-- The Path (1) finding stands unchanged --- SS13 still does not reduce
-- to Hook 3 (trace-level) through any means. What changes is that SS13
-- now DOES specialize §HM machinery (the point-level companion), so the
-- Awkward verdict is no longer accurate.

/-- **AGORA U3 + U6 Present-Formal witness.** SS13
    (`captured_correction_needs_independent_node`) is an instance of the
    §HM30 point-level attenuation family
    (`point_fragility_positive_floor`). The proof is `rfl` at the
    theorem level --- SS13's arithmetic content IS
    `point_fragility_positive_floor` applied to (floor, nodeFloor)
    followed by `unfold reachableMismatch`. -/
